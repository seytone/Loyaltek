## The Project

This task involves demonstrating my backend and frontend skills by developing an application to search and select Magic: The Gathering cards, aligning with various specific requirements. It forms a crucial segment of the selection process to join the Loyaltek development team. Furthermore, it presents an excellent opportunity for me to showcase my ability to excel in such challenges while adhering to strict timelines.

## What I did

I created this project from scratch using Laravel with Bootstrap 5. It uses a MySQL database to store the cards in the deck. The app is 100% responsive, so you can use it on mobile devices. I implemented the PHP-SDK provided by the MTG developers. Even when the app does as expected, there is plenty of room to improve it by adding more complicated logic to the search tool, for example adding additional filters to achieve advanced search. Additionally, it would be improved by using a modern javascript framework, such as Vue or React, but it takes more time to do so. However, it was fun to work on this project.
